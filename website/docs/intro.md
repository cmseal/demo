# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 hours**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

### What you'll need

- a small miracle and a truck ton of patience and retries!

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

Feel like there's a load more to commit just to have Docusaurus there for building the documentation
